# K8s-ify Storj Satellite

This repository contains my attempt to deploy a [Storj Satellite](https://gitub.com/storj/storj) on Kubernetes.

## Requirements

To run any of the _Makefile_ targets you need to install:

* [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind).
* [kubectl].
* Bash shell.
* Unix commands: `awk`, `grep`.

## Caveats

All the operations of this repository has been tested under Linux, so it won't work for Windows but it may work on OSX.
